When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
   When I want to share or co-work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   I only need to pull from Github when the changes are exactly what I want.
